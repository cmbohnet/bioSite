        <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

	<p>Meet Sam.  He eats left.  He writes left.  Yet in sports he uses both hands.  It&#39;s a little known fact that only 1% of the population is ambidexdrous.  Sam falls in that 1%.  He started to realize it when he picked up a baseball left and football right.  Shortly thereafter his Dad observed the same when he gave Sam a baseball glove for lefties that he used yet he picked up a football and threw right.  It was then realized he could do both.  Kids start to determine hand preference between ages 2 and 4 and by 4 to 6 a clear hand preference is established.  For Sam, he continued to not choose a preference and continued to play activities with both hands.  Sam likes to be able to have this flexibility, yet at times he tires of being asked what his dominant hand is.  He just knows he can do both.

     <h3>ADVANTAGES</h3>
	<p>Sam recalls a time where he hurt his left hand and had basketball practice.  He said he was able to still go to b-ball practice because he gave his left hand a break and just shot everything right. 

Other advantages in basketball he notes is that layups are easier and defenders can&#39;t force him to a certain side. 

In football Sam explains that when he runs right, he throws right and vice versa.  Also, when a defender is on right he is able to  throw left and vice versa. 

In baseball Sam notes several advantages.  When a batter bats right he will pitch right and if batter left pitches left.  The advantage is that it is harder to see a ball coming in.  The concept is the same with hitting.  Sam is able to change depending on what the pitcher throws.  It is also nice for fielding.  When he plays first and outfield, he throws left and in the remaining positions he throws right, other than pitching, then it&#39;s both.

     <h3>CHALLENGES</h3>
	<p>Sam notes challenges to be having to practice more and twice as long as anyone else to get the same practice time in as someone who does one arm.  More work is required to get stronger on both arms as a competitor with one arm. 

He also notes a challenge to get more pitching in on games. In the past, he pitched one arm per game and the team take turns in the rotation so he  gets half as much experience. He actually needs to be in the rotation twice.  Once for each arm.   A lot of people don&#39;t understand this and don&#39;t view him as needing to be in the rotation twice. He&#39;s resolving this by working  on switch pitching. Ultimately his goal is to switch pitch by batter.  He currently has a glove that he  can use with both hands because it has 2 thumbs.  This Fall he is switch pitching by inning for the first time.  One inning right, the next inning left.
